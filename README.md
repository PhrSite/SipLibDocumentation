# The SipLibDocumentation Project
This is the GitHub Pages documentation project for the SipLib class library.

This is a [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx) project so DocFX must be installed on you system before you can build the documentation GitHub Pages static web site for the SipLib project.

To build the documentation, open a command prompt and change to the the SipLibDocumentation directory and then type docfx.

** Note: The docfx.json configuration file uses a relative path to the SipLib project so the SipLibDocumentation project must be located at the same directory level as the SipLib project. For example, if the SipLib project is located under c:\MyProjects, then the SipLibDocumentation project must also be located under \MyProjects.**

The documentation web site on github.io is setup to deploy the static web site when this project is pushed to GitHub. The documentation pages are located at [https://phrsite.github.io/SipLibDocumentation](https://phrsite.github.io/SipLibDocumentation).
