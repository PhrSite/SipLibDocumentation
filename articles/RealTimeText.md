# Real Time Text
The Real Time Text protocol (RTT, see RFC 4103) is used in NG9-1-1 to allow deaf or hard of hearing callers to communicate with 911 call takers.

The SipLib.RealTimeText namespace provides two classes for working with RTT media. The [RttSender](~/api/SipLib.RealTimeText.RttSender.yml) class is for sending RTT media and the [RttReceiver](~/api/SipLib.RealTimeText.RttReceiver.yml) class is for receiving RTT media.

The [Samples/RTT](https://github.com/PhrSite/SipLib/tree/master/Samples/RTT) directory in the SipLib GitHub repository contains two sample programs that demonstrate how to use the RttSender and the RttReceiver classes.
