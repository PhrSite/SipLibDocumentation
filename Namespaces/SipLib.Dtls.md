Classes required to support encryption and decryption of media (audio, video and Real Time Text) using the Datagram Transport Layer Security  DTLS specified in RFC 5763 and RFC 5764. The classes in this namespace are used by the RtpChannel class for encrypting and decrypting RTP media data. Users of the SipLib class library do not normally need to use the classes in this namespace.
